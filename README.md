**.NET MAUI clone** of the [Wonderous app](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/) - a visual showcase of **eight wonders of the world** made with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) by the team at [gskinner](https://gskinner.com/).

This project demonstrates how to develop **tailored UI** using .NET MAUI. However, Marvelous .NET MAUI is not just a demonstration, it is a **fully functional app** that allows users to navigate the intersection of history, art, and culture by exploring the Wonders of the World.

Thanks to the original version of the app, you can also find out how well .NET MAUI competes against Flutter, for example in terms of app performance.

## Installation

First, make sure you have your Visual Studio and .NET 8 environment set up for .NET MAUI development. If not, follow the [setup instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation). Then make sure you have your [Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?pivots=devices-android) or [iOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?pivots=devices-ios) platform set up for deployment of the application.

Once everything is set up, you can clone the repo and run the application via Visual Studio.

## Features

Marvelous .NET MAUI has highly expressive user interface, tailored to the mobile form factor, and does not conform to a stock design system. Only .NET MAUI APIs and a few community libraries are used to achieve this level of expressiveness:

- [.NET MAUI Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui) - collection of common elements for development with .NET MAUI that developers tend to replicate across multiple apps
- [SimpleToolkit](https://github.com/RadekVyM/SimpleToolkit) - library of helpers and simple, easily customizable controls
- [Draggable Grid](https://github.com/RadekVyM/Draggable-Grid-JS) - JavaScript control that allows you to arrange items of an unordered list into a grid and to move between them by dragging

### Remarkable carousel view

### Custom controls

Tailored buttons, icons and other controls that match the Wonderous design system. Some of them are just compositions of existing .NET MAUI controls, and some are (almost completely) drawn using .NET MAUI cross-platform drawing APIs, such as a slider to select the period of the currently displayed artifacts.
